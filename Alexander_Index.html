<div class="Title" id="Story">
  <h1>The story of Assassination Classroom In a Nutshell.</h1>
    <p>April<sup><a href="#TimeSpan">[1]</a></sup> 2013 Kunugigaoka Junior High's class of misfits, class 3-E, got a new teacher with the dawn of their new year, his introduction, He was a military target. More specifically, a military target with a reward of 10,000,000,000Â¥ (Ten Billion Japanese Yen.) an estimated $95,638,867.64 (Nintey-Five Million, six hundred thirty-eight thousand, eight hundred sixty seven US Dollars and sixty Four Cents.). Thretening to destroy the world on graduation, and with the moon exploding only a day or so prior, he had credibility.</p>
    <p>With their new freak of nature teacher, who has many a tenticals, can fly at Mach 20 (Twenty times the speed of sound), and quick regenerative abbilities, the class set out to kill their unkillable teacher. Unfortunatley, he's also the best teacher there can be, going out of his way to help 3-E beat the best of the best, 3-A, while also supporting each student's passions.</p>
  <p>Later the class gained:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Karma Akebane: A student who was put into 3-E for getting in too many fights.</li>
        <li>Karasuma: A gym teacher who gave them the assignment to kill Koro Sensei.</li>
        <li>Takaoka: A gym teacher who later tried to kill one of the students and half the class, just because the student was better than him.</li>
        <li>Irina Jelavich: An English teacher raised to be an exeptional assassin, She also suits to Koro Sensei's <i>Perverted</i> nature.</li>
        <li>Ritsu: A Robot specificallydesigned to Kill Koro Sensei, Failing because he changed her hardware so that she understood the other students needs.</li>
        <li>Itona: A student who claimed he was Koro Sensei's brother, because they had the same genetic enhancements done to eachother, just Itona's was centralised in his hair instead of all over.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>As time went on, Kayano, a student who joined to avenge her sister, let her tenticles loose, ones that she stole from the same place that Koro Sensei got his, and tried to be the ultimatum. Once everything was said and done, Kayano got the tenticles removed and Koro Sensei's past was revealed. He was a well known Assassin named "The Reaper", When that happened, 3-E made the executive decision to instead <b>SAVE</b> Koro Sensei.</p>
    <p>In the end, it was left up to the decision of who will kill him, the government, or the students, leading to their final farewell on the campus that they've held so dear, and the one who made them cherish it so much.</p>
